# change_extension
A bash script to change file extensions in a directory recursively

To run this script, please follow the steps below:
a. Copy change_extension.sh in the directory in which you would like to change extension of files.
b. Run commmand chmod +x change_extension.sh
c. Now in order to change extension, run sh change_extension <from_extension> <to_extension>

I used this utility to rename .html.tmp files created from httrack utility to .html extension.
